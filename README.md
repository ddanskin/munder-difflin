# munder-diffli
In this project, I built a sample webpage for a fictitious company called "Munder Difflin Paper".
Often times, paper companies and office supply type companies follow a similar trend with numerous 
products splashed across the page. In an effort to break that mold and make the page more exciting, 
I used an inspirational-type slideshow. My intention was to show how Munder Difflin Paper was more 
than just a company that provides the customer with printer paper, they provide the resources 
customers need for planning, tracking,and creating projects. I placed the company's values second, 
to appeal to customers' sense of trust. Next I chose to use a large image of paper with a pen to 
again emphasize the role of the customer and creator, and I placed a large "Shop Now" link to invite 
the user to explore the product line. Below this, I created a testimonial section with a fade-in 
animation displaying customer quotes. Finally, I created a contact section where the customers could 
enter their email address to get assistance with their order or any questions.
